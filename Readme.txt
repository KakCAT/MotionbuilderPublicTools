This is ment to be a python library, the folders I will make will be modules with an __init__.py in them.

To have the scripts importing the proper modules, make sure you add this repository into your environment variables.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvJL6AlTI8 -> Video tutorial on how to add an environment var.

Other than that, feel free to use the scripts I will be adding in here in your projects, and if it's possible, give
credits :)


project-discord.com is the project I am working at the moment, have a peek and let me know if you like it.
