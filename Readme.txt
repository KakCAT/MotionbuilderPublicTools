This is meant to be a python library, the folders I will make will be modules with an __init__.py in them.

To have the scripts importing the proper modules, make sure you add this repository into your environment variables.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvJL6AlTI8 -> Video tutorial on how to add an environment var.

Other than that, feel free to use the scripts as you like, if possible, give some credits if they helped you in any good way :).


project-discord.com is the project I am working at the moment, have a peek and let me know if you like it.
